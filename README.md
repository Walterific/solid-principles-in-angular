SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his book “Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices.”

The acronym SOLID stands for:

S: Single Responsibility Principle

O: Open/Closed Principle

L: Liskov Substitution Principle

I: Interface Segregation Principle

D: Dependency Inversion Principle
